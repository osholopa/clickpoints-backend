# Clickpoints Back-end
This the back-end of a simple multiplayer button click game made with [express](https://expressjs.com/) and [socket.io](https://socket.io/).
The [front-end](https://github.com/osholopa/clickpoints-frontend) is in a separate repository.

#### Note: In order to run the scripts defined in package.json properly, this repository needs to be cloned inside the same directory as the [front-end](https://github.com/osholopa/clickpoints-frontend)

## Installation
Follow these instructions to get the server running locally. These instructions are intended for 
Windows/Mac users, but on Linux the steps are very similar.
1. Ensure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed
2. Open Git Bash/Terminal in the directory where you want the project to be saved. Clone the front-end repo to the same directory later.
3. Clone this repository by typing `git clone https://github.com/osholopa/clickpoints-backend.git` into the console. Run the command by pressing Enter. Insert your Github credentials if required.
4. Move to the created folder by typing `cd clickpoints-backend`.
5. Install project dependencies with the command `npm install`.
6. Run the command `npm start`.
7. A local server should start listening on port 3001.
8. If you haven't yet, set-up the [front-end](https://github.com/osholopa/clickpoints-frontend).
